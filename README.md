# accessible-marketing-site


## Description

An accessible website for marketing, with starter code that I cleaned up by adding semantic HTML elements, condensing the CSS elements into a more structured appearance, adding alt attributes for accessibility, with a result of the same view of the website, with more organized and readble HTML and CSS files.
